I'd really like to have something like what racket has...
(and perhaps all other R5RS schemes?) their hygenic-macros
really seem to DWIM, and interact with modules really well.

On the other hand, common-lisp style macros seem to be
easier to implement... on the OTHER, OTHER hand, it's not
like I even know how to implement those.
